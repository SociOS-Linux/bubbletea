The fun, functional and stateful way to build terminal apps. A Go framework
based on [The Elm Architecture][elm]. Bubble Tea is well-suited for simple and
complex terminal applications, either inline, full-window, or a mix of both.

Bubble Tea is in use in production and includes a number of features and
performance optimizations we’ve added along the way. Among those is a standard
framerate-based renderer, a renderer for high-performance scrollable
regions which works alongside the main renderer, and mouse support.

To get started, see the tutorial below, the [examples][examples], the
[docs][docs] and some common [resources](#libraries-we-use-with-bubble-tea).

## By the way

Be sure to check out [Bubbles][bubbles], a library of common UI components for Bubble Tea.

## Getting Started

We recommend starting with our [basics tutorial](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea/tree/master/tutorials/basics) followed by our [commands tutorial](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea/tree/master/tutorials/commands) to understand what you can do with `tea.Cmd` and how they're used in BubbleTea. 

Additionally, we have have [documentation](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea/tree/master/docs) that include frequently asked questions, issues, and more in-depth explanations on specific topics. 

## Debugging with Delve

Since Bubble Tea apps assume control of of stdin and stdout, you’ll need to run
delve in headless mode and then connect to it:

```bash
# Start the debugger
$ dlv debug --headless .
API server listening at: 127.0.0.1:34241

# Connect to it from another terminal
$ dlv connect 127.0.0.1:34241
```

Note that the default port used will vary on your system and per run, so
actually watch out what address the first `dlv` run tells you to connect to.
